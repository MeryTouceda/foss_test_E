## Clara Qin

University of California, Santa Cruz

PhD Student

Advisor: [Kai Zhu](https://zhulab.ucsc.edu/)

GitHub ([here](https://github.com/claraqin))

Clara is an ecologist, statistician, and sociologist of science with a broad interest in soil microbiota. Her ecological research examines how changing climates influence soil microbial communities, plant-soil feedbacks, and ecosystem processes in North American forests and grasslands. Her sociological research explores the “probiotic turn” in the agronomic sciences as a site of ontological politics for soil.

* ## Emily Quach

San Mateo County Community College District

Adjunct Faculty

GitHub [here](https://github.com/emilyvquach/MyfirstGithub/blob/main/README.md)

Capstone Statement: Emily's background is in molecular biology, microbiology, and parasitology. Currently, Emily is a first year adjunct intructor at community college. As a life long learner, she hopes to implement FOSS knowledge in her classes. Her plan is to learn all she can about open science, bioinfomatics, and the wolrd of coding over the next 2 years. After gaining all this in silico world, she will provide her students with data collected over the years so she may pass on the knowledge. This webpage is to her refresh the class in the future. My greatest barrier to the tools is new to coding and using new languages. Using R markdown is a tool I will try to apply right away, its a fast way to type and create pages.

__Questions__: 

- Which tool could you apply right away and why?

Git/GitHub to collaborate with team mates and other scientists.
Docker to use software created by others. 


- What is your greatest barrier to these tools?

The system where I work, the HPC, uses a Singularity instead of docker, it is not as straight forward to implement as I thought. 


- What tools would you wish we covered more in depth?
